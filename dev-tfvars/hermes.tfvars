# SHARED STORAGE CONFIGURATION
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# At least two shared storages are created for the Slurm cluster:
# 1. "Jail" storage that keeps the root directory of the shared environment within which users interact with Slurm.
#    Can be either a compute file storage or a GlusterFS.
# 2. "Controller spool" storage that keeps the state of Slurm controller (the Slurm's "StateSaveLocation"). This state
#    is shared between the primary and backup controllers.
# In addition, an arbitrary number of "jail submount" storages can be created. These storages are mounted into the jail
# environment at specified paths. For example, you can mount /home directory from a different storage, or have separate
# storages with datasets or checkpoints.
# All jail submounts are compute file storages.

### Whether to create a Slurm cluster within this terraform. If false, only the operator is created, without a cluster.
